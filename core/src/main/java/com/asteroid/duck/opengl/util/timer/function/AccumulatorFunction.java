 * multiplies it by the current {@link #getSpeed() speed}, and adds the result to an internal
 * accumulator. The accumulator grows indefinitely — it never wraps or resets — so it is suitable
 * for driving continuous animations such as rotation angles or texture offsets that should run
 * at a controllable pace without periodic discontinuities.</p>
 *
 * <p>Speed is clamped to [{@link #getMinSpeed()}, {@link #getMaxSpeed()}] on every
 * {@link #setSpeed} call, so it can be driven directly from user input without needing to guard
 * against runaway values.</p>
